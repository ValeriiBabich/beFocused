# BeFocused App (Goal Tracker)
        BeFocused is a convenient personal space for any students,
        learners or other interested in self-education and self-development people.
        Moreover, settings goals in the right way can help you achieve them! Each goal should be SMART, and here's what it means:
        Well defined, clear, and unambigous
        Measurable: With specific criteria that measure your progress towards the accomplishment of the goal
        Realistic: Within reach, realistic, and relevant to your life purpose
        Timely: With a cleary defined timeline, including a strating date and a target done. The purpose is to create urgency.
